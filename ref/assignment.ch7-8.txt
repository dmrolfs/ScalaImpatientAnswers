Chapter 7

4. Why do you think the Scala language designers provided the package object syntax instead of simply letting you add functions and variables to a package?

5. What is the meaning of private[com] def giveRaise(rate: Double)? Is it useful?

6. Write a program that copies all elements from a Java hash map into a Scala
hash map. Use imports to rename both classes.

7. In the preceding exercise, move all imports into the innermost scope possible.


Chapter 8

5. Design a class Point whose x and y coordinate values can be provided in a constructor. Provide a subclass LabeledPoint whose constructor takes a label value and x and y coordinates, such as

new LabeledPoint("Black Thursday", 1929, 230.07)

6. Design an abstract class Shape with an abstract method centerPoint and subclasses Rectangle and Circle. Provide appropriate constructors for the subclasses and override the centerPoint method in each subclass.

7. Provide a class Square that extends Rectangle and has three constructors: one that constructs a square with a given corner point and width, one that constructs a square with corner (0, 0) and a given width, and one that constructs a square with corner (0, 0) and width 0.
