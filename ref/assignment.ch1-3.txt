Chapter 1 - Exercises
1. In the Scala REPL, type 3. followed by the Tab key. What methods can be applied?

5. What does 10 max 2 mean? In which class is the max method de ned?

7. What do you need to import so that you can get a random prime as probablePrime(100, Random), without any quali ers before probablePrime and Random?

9. How do you get the first character of a string in Scala? The last character?

10. What do the take, drop, takeRight, and dropRight string functions do? What advantage or disadvantage do they have over using substring?


Chapter 2 - Exercises

1. The signum of a number is 1 if the number is positive, –1 if it is negative, and 0 if it is zero. Write a function that computes this value.

4. Write a Scala equivalent for the Java loop
for (int i = 10; i >= 0; i--) System.out.println(i);

6. Write a for loop for computing the product of the Unicode codes of all letters in a string. For example, the product of the characters in "Hello" is 9415087488L.

9. Write a recursive function of the preceding.

10. Write a function that computes x^n , where n is an integer. Use the following recursive definition:
  - x^n = y · y if n is even and positive, where y = x^(n/2)
  - x^n = x · x^(n-1) if n is odd and positive.
  - x^0 = 1
  - x^n = 1 / x if n is negative.
Don’t use a return statement.


Chapter 3 - Exercises

1. Write a code snippet that sets a to an array of n random integers between 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive).

2. Write a loop that swaps adjacent elements of an array of integers. For example, Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) becomes Array(2, 1, 4, 3, 5).

3. Repeat the preceding assignment, but produce a new array with the swapped values. Use for/yield.

4. Given an array of integers, produce a new array that contains all positive values of the original array, in their original order, followed by all values that are zero or negative, in their original order.

5. How do you compute the average of an Array[Double]?

6. How do you rearrange the elements of an Array[Int] so that they appear in reverse sorted order? How do you do the same with an ArrayBuffer[Int]?

8. Suppose you are given an array buffer of integers and want to remove all but the first negative number. Here is a sequential solution that sets a flag when the first negative number is called, then removes all elements beyond.

  var first = true
  var n = a.length
  var i = 0
  while (i < n) {
    if (a(i) >= 0) i += 1 
    else {
      if (first) { first = false; i += 1 }
      else { a.remove(i); n -= 1 } 
    }
  }

This is a complex and inefficient solution. Rewrite it in Scala by collecting positions of the negative elements, dropping the first element, reversing the sequence, and calling a.remove(i) for each index.

9. Improve the solution of the preceding exercise by collecting the positions that should be moved and their target positions. Make those moves and truncate the buffer. Don’t copy any elements before the first unwanted element.
